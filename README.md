# Plant Disease Prediction - CNN Deep Learning Project

This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant diseases based on leaf images. By using this model, you can accurately identify a variety of plant diseases and take corrective measures early.

# Project Setup Instructions

## 1. Create a Virtual Environment

### Mac/Linux
To create and activate a virtual environment, use the following commands:

\`\`\`bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
\`\`\`

### Windows
To create and activate a virtual environment, use:

\`\`\`cmd
python -m venv venv
.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
\`\`\`

## 2. Install Dependencies

After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

## 3. Running the Application

Start the application using Streamlit:

\`\`\`bash
streamlit run app/main.py
\`\`\`

This will start a local server. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (typically [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).
